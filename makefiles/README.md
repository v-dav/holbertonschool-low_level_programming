# Makefiles

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to  explain to anyone,  **without the help of Google**:

### General
-   What are  `make`, Makefiles
-   When, why and how to use Makefiles
-   What are rules and how to set and use them
-   What are explicit and implicit rules
-   What are the most common / useful rules
-   What are variables and how to set and use them

# Project files:

- 1-Makefile: requirements: exec School, rules all, variables: CC, SRC
