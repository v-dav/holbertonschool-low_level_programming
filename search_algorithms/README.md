# :mortar_board:C - Search Algorithms

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone **without the help of Google**:

- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

# Project files:
- 0-linear.c --> a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm
- 1-binary?c --> a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm
- search_algos.h --> header file for the project
- 2-O to 6-O --> files describing time and space complexity of various algorithms
