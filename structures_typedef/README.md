# :mortar_board:C - Structures, typedef

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to  explain to anyone,  **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   What are structures, when, why and how to use them

-   How to use  `typedef`
  

# Project files:

 - dog.h --> Defines a new type `struct dog`
 
 -1-init_dog.c --> a function that initialize a variable of type  `struct dog`

- 2-print_dog.c --> a function that prints a `struct dog`

-  dog.h (UPDATE) --> Defines a new type `dog_t` as a new name for the type `struct dog`.

- 4-new_dog.c --> a function that creates a new dog

- 5-free_dog.c --> a function that frees dogs.
