# C - Pointers, arrays and strings: project 1


At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to  explain to anyone,  **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   What are pointers and how to use them
-   What are arrays and how to use them
-   What are the differences between pointers and arrays
-   How to use strings and how to manipulate them
-   Scope of variables

  

# Project files:

  - 0-reset_to_98.c --> a function that takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.
  
  - 1-swap.c --> a function that swaps the values of two integers.

- 2-strlen.c --> a function that returns the length of a string.

- 3-puts.c --> a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`

- 4-print_rev.c --> a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

- 5-rev_string.c --> a function that reverses a string.

- 6-puts2.c --> a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

- 7-puts_half.c --> a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

- 8-print_array.c --> a function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

- 9-strcpy.c --> a function that copies the string pointed to by  `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by  `dest`.

- 100-atoi.c --> a function that convert a string to an integer.

# Project 2 files:

- 0-strcat.c —> a function that concatenates two strings.

- 1-strncat.c —> a function that concatenates two strings.

- 2-strncpy.c —> a function that copies a string.

- 3-strcmp.c —-> a function that compares two strings.

- 4-rev_array.c —> a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

- 5-string_toupper.c —> a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

- 6-cap_string.c —> a function that capitalizes all words of a string.

- 7-leet.c —> a function that encodes a string into 1337.
