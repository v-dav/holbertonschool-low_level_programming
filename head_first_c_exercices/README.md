# :mortar_board: Head First C Exercises Repository

Welcome to my Head First C Exercises Repository! This repository contains exercise files that I created from the book "Head First C" for learning the C programming language.

In this repository, you will find a collection of C programming exercises that cover various topics, including data types, variables, control structures, functions, pointers, arrays, and more. These exercises help me to reinforce my understanding of the concepts covered in the book and improve my C programming skills.

Feel free to explore the repository and use the exercise files to practice your own C programming skills. You can also contribute to this repository by adding your own exercises or improving existing ones.

To get started, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine and open the exercise files in your favorite text editor or integrated development environment (IDE). Happy coding! :)
