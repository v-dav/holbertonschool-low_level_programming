# :mortar_board:C - Recursion


At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to  explain to anyone,  **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   What is recursion
-   How to implement recursion
-   In what situations you should implement recursion
-   In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion
  

# Project files:

 - 0-puts_recursion.c --> a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
 
 - 1-print_rev_recursion.c --> a function that prints a string in reverse.
 
 - 2-strlen_recursion.c --> a function that returns the length of a string.

- 3-factorial.c --> a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

- 4-pow_recursion.c --> a function that returns the value of  `x`  raised to the power of  `y`.

- 5-sqrt_recursion.c --> a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

- 6-is_prime_number.c --> a function that returns `1` if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return `0`.
