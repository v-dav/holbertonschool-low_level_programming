# C - Function pointers

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to  explain to anyone,  **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   What are function pointers and how to use them

-   What does a function pointer exactly hold

-   Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory
  

# Project files:

 - 0-print_name.c --> a function that prints a name.

 - 1-array_iterator.c --> a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
 
 - 2-int_index.c --> a function that searches for an integer.
 
 - 3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h --> a program that performs simple operations.
