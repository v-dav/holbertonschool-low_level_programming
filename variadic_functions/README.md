# :mortar_board:C - Variadic functions

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to  explain to anyone,  **without the help of Google**:

### General

-  What are variadic functions

-   How to use  `va_start`,  `va_arg`  and  `va_end`  macros

-   Why and how to use the  `const`  type qualifier

# Project files:

 - 0-sum_them_all.c --> Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
 
 - 1-print_numbers.c --> a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line

- 2-print_strings.c --> a function that prints strings, followed by a new line

- 3-print_all.c --> a function that prints anything.
