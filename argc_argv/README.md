# C - argc, argv


At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to  explain to anyone,  **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   How to use arguments passed to your program

-   What are two prototypes of  `main`  that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other

-   How to use  `__attribute__((unused))`  or  `(void)`  to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
  

# Project files:

 - 0-whatsmyname.c --> a program that prints its name, followed by a new line.
 
 - 1-args.c --> a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.

- 2-args.c --> a program that prints all arguments it receives.

- 3-mul.c --> a program that multiplies two numbers

- 4-add.c --> a program that adds positive numbers.
