# :mortar_board: C - Preprocessor

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to  explain to anyone,  **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   What are macros and how to use them
-   What are the most common predefined macros
-   How to include guard your header files
  

# Project files:

 - 0-object_like_macro.h --> creates a header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.
 
 - 1-pi.h --> Create a header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.
 
 - 2-main.c --> a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.

- 3-function_like_macro.h --> a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

- 4-sum.h --> a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
