# C - malloc, free


At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to  explain to anyone,  **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
-   What is  `malloc`  and  `free`  and how to use them
-   Why and when use  `malloc`
-   How to use  `valgrind`  to check for memory leak
  

# Project files:

 - 0-create_array.c —> a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.

- 1-strdup.c —> a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

- 2-str_concat.c —> a function that concatenates two strings.

- 3-alloc_grid.c —> a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

- 4-free_grid.c —> a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.
