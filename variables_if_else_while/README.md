# :mortar_board:C - Variables, if, else, while: Learning Objectives

  

At the end of this project, I amexpected to be able to explain to anyone,  **without the help of Google**:

  

- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

- What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them

- What the the relational operators and how to use them

- What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C

- What are the boolean operators and how to use them

- How to use the  `if`,  `if ... else`  statements

- How to use comments

- How to declare variables of types  `char`,  `int`,  `unsigned int`

- How to assign values to variables

- How to print the values of variables of type  `char`,  `int`,  `unsigned int`  with  `printf`

- How to use the  `while`  loop

- How to use variables with the  `while`  loop

- How to print variables using  `printf`

- What is the  `ASCII`  character set

- What are the purpose of the  `gcc`  flags  `-m32`  and  `-m64`
