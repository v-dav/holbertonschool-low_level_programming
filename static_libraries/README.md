# :mortar_board:C - Static Libraries


At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to  explain to anyone,  **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
-   Basic usage of  `ar`,  `ranlib`,  `nm`
  

# Project files:

 - libmy.a, main.h : the static library  `libmy.a`  containing all the functions listed below. main.h is a header file with prototypes
 
 - create_static_lib.sh: a script that creates a static library called `liball.a` from all the `.c` files that are in the current directory.
